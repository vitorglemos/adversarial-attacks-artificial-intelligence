# Adversarial Attacks In Artificial Intelligence

## Introduction
Machine learning models have become increasingly important in various industries, from healthcare to finance to autonomous vehicles. However, as these models become more prevalent, there is a growing concern about their vulnerability to attacks. Adversarial attacks refer to the deliberate manipulation of data or algorithms to cause a machine learning model to misbehave or provide incorrect results. These attacks can have serious consequences, such as causing a self-driving car to misidentify an object on the road or allowing a fraudster to bypass security measures in a financial system. Therefore, understanding and mitigating the risks posed by adversarial attacks is crucial for the continued development and deployment of machine learning models.

## Types of Adversarial Attacks

 * **Gradient-based attacks**: These attacks involve manipulating the gradients used in the model's optimization process to trick the model into making incorrect predictions.
 * **Poisoning attacks**: The attacker injects malicious data into the training dataset to manipulate the model's behavior.
 * **Evasion attacks**: Evasion attacks involve modifying the input data to the model in such a way that it causes the model to produce incorrect results.
 * **Data extraction attacks**: The attacker tries to extract sensitive information from the model by submitting carefully crafted queries to the model.
 * **Model inversion attacks**: Model inversion attacks attempt to reverse-engineer the model's parameters or inputs from its outputs.
 * **Backdoor attacks**: Backdoor attacks involve inserting a hidden trigger or pattern into the model during training, which can be later exploited by the attacker to manipulate the model's behavior.
